# Evan's first CS193 Homework
Some of my favorite things about CS 193:
- The class is run by TAs that are my age, makes it feel less intimidating
- The TAs took this class so they know what will be helpful for me
- I don't have much programming experience, so this will help me improve and do better in CS180
- It is an easy way to meet people in my major
